## Sepcial Things ##
This project is an experimentational piece where we got to explore and implement the following:

* Walkmesh as base floor walking 
* Ray-box collision based on orientaiton of a mesh 
* Procedural walking animation based on target point, rig hierarchy, and orientation of body mesh
(note : procedural walking isn't shown as part of the gameplay, but the demo can be viewed in Joyce branch)

Other resources we looked at are commented at where the respective concept has been used throughout the file.



This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
